EKGYO.IS,Real Estate,826.0,"In 1953, a mentality that would lead the urbanization efforts of a country and improve the people's life quality was born. In that year, Emlak Konut, the deep-rooted brand of the construction industry, started its journey of success. The corporate vision was decided to build environmentally conscious modern cities that add comfort to human life. With this purpose, Emlak Konut became the architect of many innovative practices in the industry. Emlak Konut delivered many projects leaving a good example and traces for planned urbanization in our country. It built the most innovative neighborhoods of its era with projects so large that even their surroundings were named after them. This stable growth brought up a significant milestone as well. In 2002, Emlak Konut turned into a real estate investment company. This transformation was the herald for the giant projects, barnburners and becoming an even bigger company. After the establishment of the real estate investment company, Emlak Konut initiated 139 new projects that would have a broad effect on the world, embody environmentally conscious technologies and add value to cities. The number of units built and tendered since 2003 has reached 129.000 Emlak Konut went public twice, crowning its fast growth and taking its targets to wider horizons. The initial public offering which took place in 2010, ranked among the top 5 public offerings in the Republic's history. The second one, in 2013, became the greatest real estate public offering in the last 5 years in Europe. Growing with public offerings, Emlak Konut strengthens its place among the largest companies in Turkey with its paid-in capital of TRY 3,8 billion and its total value of assets of TRY 24,8 billion. Since its foundation, Emlak Konut has been taking firm steps towards the future with its increasing momentum, human-oriented corporate culture and its latest state.
